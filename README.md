<img src="https://zhaoph2008.github.io/img.jpg" alt="GitHub" title="img" width="150" height="150" /><br>
My name is Pengli Zhao. I am a graduate student at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. I’m interested in Air Traffic Management, Arrival Sequencing and Scheduling, Trajectory Analysis and Data Visualization.
This is my [CV](./cv/cv.pdf).

## Research Interests
Arrival Management, Air traffic Simulation, Trajectory analysis and Airport Operation.
## Education
- Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics<br>
M.S. Candidate in Air traffic control automation and intelligence, _Sep.2017-Present_<br>
Research focus: Arrival Sequencing and scheduling<br>
Advisor: Prof. [Junfeng Zhang](http://cca.nuaa.edu.cn/2017/1110/c4798a102560/page.htm)

- Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics <br>
Bachelor in Air Traffic Management, _Sep.2013-Jul.2017_

## Project Experience:
### DST for AMAN under CDO
_Collaboration with Boeing (China) Research and Technology and COMAC<br>
December 2017 – July 2019_<br>
This project was aiming to develop a decision support tool for ANAN under Continue Descent Operation (CDO). It could receive real-time data from radar simulator and make online sequencing and scheduling. My work focus on function and HMI(Human Machine Interface) development.
-	Developed sequencing and scheduling function, go-around function.
-	Developed insight and vivid Human Machine Interface.
    - Display the sequencing information and Aircraft position in real-time.
    - Proposed indicators of terminal status and visualized them with charts.
-	Experimented on AMAN to verify the function.

### AMAN Performance Evaluation
_Collaboration with Central South Air Traffic Management Bureau, CAAC<br>
December 2017 - November 2019_<br>
This project was aiming to analysis historical radar data to evaluate the potential improvement after using AMAN in ZGHA. My work focus on Radar Data decoding and data visualization.
-	Studied the `CAT062 (SDPS Track Messages) `Documentation.
-	Developed a tool to parser data automatically.
-	Developed a tool to replay the trajectory data for analysis.

### PMS (Point Merge System) Flight Procedure evaluation
_Collaboration with Airspace Management Center, ATMB, CAAC<br>
May 2019 - November 2019_<br>
This project was aiming to use radar simulator to evaluate a flight procedure designed for PMS in ZSPD. My work focus on trajectory data decoding and Vilification.
-	Captured the ADS-B data from [OpenSky Database](https://opensky-network.org/) to find the PMS operation in Europe;
-	Decoded the Radar Data in order to compare the operation performance and simulation result.
-	Learned two ways to query the database([SQL query](https://opensky-network.org/data/impala) and [Python API](https://github.com/xoolive/traffic)).
