## Project Experience

### AMAN Performance Evaluation
_Collaboration with Central South Air Traffic Management Bureau, CAAC<br>
December 2017 - November 2019_<br>
This project was aiming to analyze historical radar data to evaluate the potential benefits after using
AMAN in Changsha Approach. I cooperate with a partner, my work focuses on radar data decoding
and AMAN structure research. His work focuses on indicator selection and evaluation.
- Design and development of tool for radar data decoding and visualization.
   - Studied radar-encoding documentation.
   - Development of automatic decoding tool and trajectory visitation tool for analysis.
- Design of test scenarios for AMAN functions verification.
- Research based on KPI and arrival flight tightness.
   - Analyzed and clarified the KPIs and modeling for multi-objective optimization under CDO.
   - Research about the relationship between arrival tightness and computation time

### DST for AMAN under CDO
_Collaboration with Boeing (China) Research and Technology and COMAC<br>
December 2017 – July 2019_<br>
This project was aiming to develop a Decision Support Tool (DTS) for ANAN under Continue Descent
Operation (CDO). It could receive real-time data from ATC simulator and make real-time sequencing
and scheduling. My work focuses on functions development and experiment vilification.
-	 Integration of trajectory prediction method for multi-type aircraft
    - 4D trajectory prediction for step-down and CDO based on BADA3 model.
    -  Development of online trajectory prediction function.
- Design and development of sequencing algorithm and function.
    - Algorithms development for sequencing with different objectives. FCFS and SA can be alternative according to the volume of arrival flights.
    - Support sequencing under different mode of operations and special case.
- Design and development of trajectory generation strategies.
    - Trajectory allocated suggestion based on Schedule Time of Arrival (STA).
    - Trajectory generation strategies (route, height and speed scheduling).
    - Function realization of continually trajectory monitoring and deviation detecting.
- Design and development of AMAN
    - Missed-approach scheduling function and holding suggestion function.
    - Interface developed for timeline and aircraft display.
    - Programming with UDP sockets for AMAN and simulator connection.
    - Proficient with function development on Qt platform using C++.
